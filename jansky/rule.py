class Rule():
    '''A callable transformation for manipulating crash state.

    For ease of testing, this base class is implemented with predicate
    and action methods. Consumers are expected to call the object directly
    in practice.

    Previous processor implementations passed an explicit metadata object around
    to hold 'inside information' about the transformation process. The metadata
    object was used for a few specific things:

        processor_2015.py:187 - defined as a socorro.lib.util.DotDict()
        processor_2015.py:188 - defined processor_notes, a list starting with
                                the processor name and the class name, then
                                potentially appended to later
        processor_2015.py:192 - defined quit_check, now unecessary
        processor_2015.py:193 - defined processor = self
        processor_2015.py:194 - defined config = self.config
        processor_2015.py:200 - when reprocessing a crash, append a note with
                                the earlier processing time
        processor_2015.py:221 - define started_timestamp = self._log_job_start,
                                which wrote out that a job was starting as an
                                INFO log. Curiously, the method doensn't return
                                so I'm not sure what is being saved here,
                                exactly.
        processor_2015.py:235 - pass the metadata to a rule as an kwarg after
                                processed_crash
        processor_2015.py:250 - when any unhandled exception happens during
                                processing, append it to these notes and write
                                it to logs but otherwise try to continue
        processor_2015.py:256 - extend notes with notes from any previous
                                processing
        processor_2015.py:257 - join the notes and write them to the
                                processed_crash as 'processor_notes'

    Now quit check is removed and most of the other properties are set
    without being read. the metadata can likely be replaced with a notes object
    hung directly off the processor itself.
